# EAQt Electrochemical Analyzer Software based on Qt API
This software is designed to be used with MTM-ANKO M161, and 8KCA electrochemical analyzers.
It uses its own file extenstion for handling the measurement result ".volt". The VOLT file
format is described in seperate file (VOLT_File.md). However, it is able to load .vol file
of EALab and EAGraph. This program makes use of following software:
- Qt API (https://www.qt.io) (LGPLv3 license).
- QCustomPlot (http://www.qcustomplot.com) library for displaying plots (GPLv3 license).
- Eigen library (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) for matrix operations and signals processing (MPL 2.0 license).
- kissFFT (https://sourceforge.net/projects/kissfft/) for FFT and iFFT (revised BSD license).
- pstdin.h (http://mrpt.sourceforge.net/reference/0.6.5/pstdint_8h-source.html) for compatibilty on Windows (revised BSD license).
